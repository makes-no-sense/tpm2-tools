# NAME

**tpm2_hash**(1) - Performs a hash operation with the TPM.

# SYNOPSIS

**tpm2_hash** [*OPTIONS*] _FILE_

# DESCRIPTION

**tpm2_hash**(1) - performs a hash operation on _FILE_ and returns the results. If
_FILE_ is not specified, then data is read from stdin. If the results of the
hash will be used in a signing operation that uses a restricted signing key,
then the ticket returned by this command can indicate that the hash is safe to
sign.

# OPTIONS

  * **-H**, **--hierarchy**=_HIERARCHY_:
    hierarchy to use for the ticket.
    Supported options are:
      * **o** for **TPM_RH_OWNER**
      * **p** for **TPM_RH_PLATFORM**
      * **e** for **TPM_RH_ENDORSEMENT**
      * **n** for **TPM_RH_NULL**

  * **-g**, **--halg**=_HASH\_ALGORITHM_:
    The hash algorithm to use.
    Algorithms should follow the "formatting standards, see section
    "Algorithm Specifiers".
    Also, see section "Supported Hash Algorithms" for a list of supported hash
    algorithms.

  * **-o**, **--outfile**=_OUT\_FILE_
    Optional file record of the hash result. Defaults to stdout in hex form.

  * **-t**, **--ticket**=_TICKET\_FILE_
